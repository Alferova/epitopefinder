Analysis scripts
===============================
A variety of small scripts are included for analyzing and plotting the results of running the main `epitopefinder`_ scripts.

These scripts mostly require `matplotlib`_, so you need to download and install this package in order to utilize the scripts. A few functions also use `scipy`_.
